# Project
#100Dev assignment was to use floats only to arrange a png. You will see under the assets folder the image. I was to only use float/clear in CSS to arrange how the layout would look. My HTML is basic with only tags and some classes as nothing was need within the tag. I did use classes in order to allow the layout to flow as it should with different widths and heights.
